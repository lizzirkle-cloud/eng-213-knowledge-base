layout: page
---

For how Communicating Science With YouTube works, Frontiers in Communication states that it worky by creating engaging video content for a general audience, bypassing traditional media gatekeepers to directly share research and information using visual and auditory elements.

Examples of effective science communication on YouTube include:

Kurzgesagt's animated explanations,
SciShow's educational vlogs,
The British Antarctic Survey's animations,
and the ScienceVlogs Brasil alliance of channels. 

These terms explained in a nutshell:

  Kurzgesagt's animated explanations: This channel uses visually stunning animations to explain complex scientific topics from astronomy to biology, making them highly engaging for a broad audience.

  SciShow's educational vlogs: Hank Green and others use a vlog format to explore various scientific topics, breaking down information in an accessible way for viewers.

  The British Antarctic Survey's animations: This organization created a two-minute 2D animation to explain findings from the UK Frozen Shoulder Trial, which was shared widely and praised for its accessibility.

  The ScienceVlogs Brasil alliance of channels: An alliance of independent Brazilian channels that focus on communicating science to the public in Portuguese, covering a wide range of subjects.

One example not listed above: 

  MinuteEarth and MinutePhysics: These channels, also recommended by a science communication expert, offer short, engaging explanations of various scientific concepts, similar to Kurzgesagt in their format.

The outcomes of this are: 

  Increased public engagement and interest,
  Foster long-term "long tail effect"

Now for the study behind this:
  
The study reveals that science communication on YouTube can have both immediate impact (through positive engagement and appreciation) and long-term influence, which the researchers term the long tail effect. This long tail refers to how science communication content can create lasting value over time, inspiring viewers to make significant life changes such as pursuing STEM education or maintaining prolonged engagement with scientific topics. The researchers argue that success in science communication should be measured not just by viewership metrics, but by its ability to foster meaningful connections and create lasting impact on viewers' lives, similar to how science education in schools can shape students' future interests and understanding.
